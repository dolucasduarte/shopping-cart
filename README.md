This project was developed entirely with React as a challenge for a front-end developer position.

## Shipping Rules

From the challenge description:

> - For purchases above R\$400.00 the shipping is free!
> - For purchases below or equal 10kg the shipping price is: \$30.
> - Each 5kg above 10kg will add \$7 to the shipping price.

## Vouchers

Valid vouchers you can use to test the discount code feature:

- **#30OFF:** percentual voucher of 30%
- **#100DOLLARS**: fixed voucher of \$100.00
- **#SHIPIT**: free shipping voucher with minimum value of \$300.50

## Errors

The API eventually fail with HTP 500 on purpose. These failures are handled in the project.
